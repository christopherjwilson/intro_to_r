One crucial difference is that you need to be explicit about what you want to do with your data. In a spreadsheet, you can simply click on a cell and start typing. In R, you need to tell the software what you want to do with your data. This can be a bit intimidating at first, but it is also one of the most powerful features of R. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks and perform complex analyses with just a few lines of code.\n\n## Importing data into R\n\n::: callout-tip\n## At the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n-   Load data into R from different file types\n-   Understand the structure of data in R\n:::\n\nThere are a few different ways to load data into R. You can load data from a file on your computer, from a URL, or from a package. You can load data in different file types, such as CSV, Excel, and SPSS files.\n\nUsing RStudio, you can load data by clicking on `File > Import Dataset`. This will open a window where you can select the file that you want to load.\n\nHowever, you can also load data using code. For example, you can use the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package to load a CSV file into R. You can use the `readxl` package to load an Excel file, and the `haven` package to load an SPSS file.\n\n``` r\n\n# Load the readr package\n\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Load a CSV file into R\n\ndata <- read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n```\n\nLet's break this code down:\n\n-   `library(readr)` loads the `readr` package into your R session. This package contains the `read_csv()` function, which you can use to load a CSV file into R.\n\n-   `read_csv(\"data.csv\")` reads the CSV file called `data.csv` into R. The data will be stored in an object called `data`.\n\nWhen you load data into R, it will be stored as a data frame. A data frame is a type of object in R that is used to store tabular data. It is similar to a spreadsheet in Excel, with rows and columns.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://teesside.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=b7145cd4-f5a1-400b-9cec-b18f00e0252d&amp;autoplay=false&amp;offerviewer=true&amp;showtitle=true&amp;showbrand=true&amp;captions=false&amp;interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"600\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\" aria-description=\"Importing data into R\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n## How are data stored in R?\n\nIf you worked through the previous section, you should already have some idea how to load data into R. But how are data stored in R? In R, data are stored in objects. An object is a container that holds data. There are several types of objects in R, but the most common ones are:\n\n-   Vectors (e.g., a sequence of numbers)\n-   Matrices (e.g., a table of rows and colummns, all of the same data type)\n-   Data frames (e.g., a table of data where each column represents a variable and each row represents an observation)\n-   Lists (e.g., a collection of objects)\n\nIn this section, we will focus on data frames, which are the most common way to store data in R. A data frame is a table of data where each column represents a variable and each row represents an observation. You can think of a data frame as having a structure similar to a spreadsheet.\n\n![Data frame with 3 variables/columns](images/dataframe.png)\n\n## How do we use data frames in R?\n\nTo view the data in a data frame, you can simply type the name of the data frame in the console and press Enter. For example, if you have a data frame called `my_data`, you can view the data in the data frame by typing `my_data` in the console and pressing Enter.\n\n```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}\n## load the tidyverse package\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Create a data frame\nmy_data <- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\", \"Frank\"),\n  age = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50),\n  height = c(160, 175, 180, 165, 170, 190),\n  car = c(\"Electric\", \"Petrol\", \"Electric\", \"Petrol\", \"Petrol\", \"Electric\")\n)\n\n# View or refer to the data in the data frame\n\nmy_data\n```\n\nIn the code above, we created a data frame called `my_data` with four variables: `name`, `age`, `height`, and `car`. We then used the `my_data` object to view the data in the data frame.\n\n## View or refer to a specific variable in a data frame\n\nTo view or refer to a specific variable in a data frame, you can use the `$` operator. For example, if you want to view the `age` variable in the `my_data` data frame, you can type `my_data$age` in the console and press Enter.\n\n```{r}\n\n# View or refer to a specific variable in a data frame\n\nmy_data$age\n\n```\n\n## Data types in R\n\nIn R, each variable in a data frame has a data type. The most common data types in R are:\n\n-   Numeric: for continuous variables (e.g., age, height)\n-   Factor: for categorical variables\n-   Logical: for binary variables (TRUE or FALSE)\n\nYou can use the `str()` function to view the structure of a data frame, including the data types of each variable.\n\n```{r}\n\n# View the structure of a data frame\n\nstr(my_data)\n\n```\n\nIn the code above, we used the `str()` function to view the structure of the `my_data` data frame. The output shows the data types of each variable in the data frame.\n\n## Convert data types in R\n\nYou can convert the data type of a variable in R using the `as.` functions. For example, you can convert a character variable to a factor variable using the `as.factor()` function.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Convert a character variable to a factor variable\n\nmy_data$name <- as.factor(my_data$name)\n\nmy_data$car <- as.factor(my_data$car)\n\n```\n\nIn the code above, we converted the `name` variable in the `my_data` data frame from a character variable to a factor variable using the `as.factor()` function.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://teesside.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=d5a50c91-bcd1-4d81-a35c-b1be009a7219&autoplay=false&offerviewer=false&showtitle=false&showbrand=false&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"600\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\" aria-description=\"Dataframes and changing variable types\" ></iframe>\n\n\n## Subsetting data in R\n\n::: callout-tip\n## At the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n-   Filter data in R\n-   Create subsets of data in R\n\n:::\n\nSubsetting data in R means selecting a subset of the data based on certain criteria. For example, you might want to select only the rows where a certain variable is greater than a certain value, or only the columns that contain certain variables.\n\nIf we use the `my_data` data frame from the previous section, we can subset the data to select only the rows where the `age` variable is greater than 30.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Filter the data frame to select only the rows where the age variable is greater than 30\n\n# this method uses the dplyr package, which is a part of the tidyverse. Be sure to load the tidyverse package if you haven't already.\n\nmy_data %>% filter(age > 30)\n\n```\n\nLet's break this code down:\n\n-   `my_data` is the data frame that we want to subset.\n-   `%>%` is the pipe operator, which is used to pass the data frame to the next function. This allows us to link multiple steps together in a single line of code.\n-   `filter(age > 30)` is the function that filters the data frame to select only the rows where the `age` variable is greater than 30.\n\nThe output of this code will be a new data frame that contains only the rows where the `age` variable is greater than 30. However, this new data frame will not be saved anywhere, so if you want to save it, you need to assign it to a new object. Tp do this, you can use the assignment operator `<-`.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Filter the data frame to select only the rows where the age variable is greater than 30 and save the result to a new data frame called new_data\n\nnew_data <- my_data %>% filter(age > 30)\n\n```\n\nIn this code, on the left side of the assignment operator `<-`, we have `new_data`, which is the name of the new data frame that will contain only the filtered subset of the data (i.e., the values where the `age` variable is greater than 30). The difference between this code and the previous code is that we are now saving the result to a new data frame called `new_data`, instead of just printing it to the console.\n\nWe can also combine multiple conditions when subsetting data. For example, we can select only the rows where the `age` variable is greater than 25 and the `height` variable is greater than 175.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Filter the data frame to select only the rows where the age variable is greater than 25 and the height variable is greater than 175\n\nmy_data %>% filter(age > 25 & height > 175)\n\n```\n\nThere are many other ways to subset data in R, depending on the criteria you want to use. For example, you can use the `select()` function to select specific columns, the `arrange()` function to sort the data, and the `mutate()` function to create new variables. We will cover some of these functions in later sections.\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://teesside.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=782e858e-49f9-492d-9891-b1be00a337c0&autoplay=false&offerviewer=false&showtitle=false&showbrand=false&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"600\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\" aria-description=\"Filtering and subsetting data\" ></iframe>\n\n## Grouping and summarising data in R\n\n::: callout-tip\n## At the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n-   Group data in R\n-   Summarise data in R\n:::\n\nGrouping and summarising data in R means grouping the data by one or more variables and then calculating summary statistics for each group. For example, you might want to calculate the mean age for each group of people based on their height.\n\nIf we use the `my_data` data frame from the previous section, we can group the data by the `car` variable and then calculate the mean age for each group.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Group the data frame by the car variable and calculate the mean age for each group\n\nmy_data %>% group_by(car) %>% \n  summarise(mean_age = mean(age)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n```\n\nLet's break this code down:\n\n-   `my_data` is the data frame that we want to group and summarise.\n-   `%>%` is the pipe operator, which is used to pass the data frame to the next function. This allows us to link multiple steps together in a single line of code.\n-   `group_by(car)` is the function that groups the data frame by the `car` variable.\n-   `summarise(mean_age = mean(age))` is the function that calculates the mean age for each group of cars. The `mean_age` variable is the name of the new variable that will contain the mean age for each group.\n-  `ungroup()` is the function that removes the grouping from the data frame. This is optional, but it is good practice to ungroup the data frame after you have finished summarising it.\n\nThe output of this code will be a new data frame that contains the mean age for each group of cars. The `car` variable is the grouping variable, and the `mean_age` variable is the summary statistic that we calculated for each group.\n\nYou can also calculate other summary statistics, such as the median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum, using the `summarise()` function. You can also calculate multiple summary statistics at the same time by specifying multiple variables inside the `summarise()` function. For example, you can calculate the mean and standard deviation of the age variable for each group of cars.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Group the data frame by the car variable and calculate the mean and standard deviation of the age variable for each group\n\nmy_data %>% group_by(car) %>% \n  summarise(mean_age = mean(age), sd_age = sd(age)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n```\n\nIn this code, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the `age` variable for each group of cars. The `mean_age` and `sd_age` variables are the names of the new variables that will contain the mean and standard deviation for each group.\n\n\n<iframe
