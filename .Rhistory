# Let's write the exam questions based on this dataset.
# Research Scenario:
# A research team is investigating the effectiveness of different psychological treatments on improving mental health outcomes. They have collected data from 500 participants who were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: Treatment as Usual (control), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The outcome variable represents a mental health score which was measured at two timepoints and converted to a change score (i.e. the difference between pre and post scores). Higher values indicate improvement. Additionally, the dataset includes measures of sleep quality, stress level and age.
# Recent research has indicated that sleep quality may moderate the effectiveness of psychological treatments, while historically, stress level has been considered a covariate that could influence mental health outcomes. The research team is interested in understanding how these factors interact with treatment conditions to affect post-treatment mental health scores. In particular, they want to explore whether better sleep quality enhances the effectiveness of CBT and ACT compared to the control condition, while controlling for stress levels.
# Exam Questions:
# 1. What are the mean and sd outcome scores for each treatment condition?
# 2. The average sleep score in the population is 55. How do these participants compare to the population average in terms of sleep quality, based on the mean and sd of the sample?
# 3. The dataset contains participants who are under the age of 18 and over the age of 65. The research team wants to focus on adults aged 18-65. Filter the dataset to include only participants within this age range and recalculate the mean and sd outcome scores for each treatment condition.
# Using the filtered dataset conduct an analysis to investigate the researchers' main question. In doing so, you should be able to address the following:
# 4. Does treatment condition significantly predict a change in outcome scores?
# 5. Does stress level significantly predict change in outcome scores?
# 6. Does sleep quality moderate the relationship between treatment condition and outcome scores, after controlling for stress level?
# 7. If yes to question 6, at what levels of sleep quality is the effect of treatment condition on outcome scores significant?
# 8. Provide a brief interpretation of the results from questions 4 and 5, including any relevant statistics (e.g., effect sizes, p-values) and what they suggest about the effectiveness of the treatments in relation to sleep quality and stress level.
# 9. Do the assumption checks for the analysis indicate anything we should be concerned about? Does this change how we interpret the results?
