<h2>What is statistical significance?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In short: Statistical significance is a test of how compatible the data are with the null hypothesis. It does not tell us what our data proves, only that it is unlikely that the null hypothesis is true.</p>

<h2>The problem with statistical significance</h2>

<p>“It’s science’s dirtiest secret: The ‘scientific method’ of testing hypotheses by statistical analysis stands on a flimsy foundation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February 2014, George Cobb, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics and Statistics at Mount Holyoke College, posed these questions to an ASA discussion forum:</p>
<p>Q: Why do so many colleges and grad schools teach p = 0.05?</p>
<p>A: Because that’s still what the scientific community and journal editors use.</p>
<p>Q: Why do so many people still use p = 0.05?</p>
<p>A: Because that’s what they were taught in college or grad school.</p>

<li>Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency.</li>

<h2>Using confidence intervals to interpret results</h2>
<ul>
<li>Confidence intervals are a better way to interpret results than p-values.</li>
<li>A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a parameter.</li>
<li>For example, a 95% confidence interval for a mean says:
<ul>
<li>If we were to collect the same sample 100 times and calculate a 95% confidence interval of the mean for each sample, 95 of the intervals would contain the true population mean.</li>

<section id="how-do-we-report-confidence-intervals" class="slide level2">
<h2>How do we report Confidence Intervals?</h2>
<p>To report confidence intervals in APA style, we need to report the lower and upper bounds of the interval, and the confidence level.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results of the t-test showed a significant difference between the two groups, t(18) = 2.43, p = .03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.45].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tells us that the true mean difference between the two groups is likely to be between 0.02 and 0.45. We can decide (depending on our research question) how meaningful this is to us.</p>

<h2>Significance does not mean importance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Over the last several decades, psychology research has become too focused on statistical significance.</li>
<li>A statistically significant result does not mean that the result is meaningful or important.</li>
<li>The focus on statistical significance has led to a number of problems:

<h2>What is effect size?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When we conduct research, we are usually asking a question about a difference or a relationship.
<ul>
<li>For example, we might be interested in whether there is a difference in the mean score on a measure between clinical two groups.</li>
<li>Or we might be interested in whether there is a relationship between two variables.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, different studies use different samples and measures, and so the results of these studies are not directly comparable.</li>

<li>Odds ratio</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Power is ability to detect an effect if it exists</p></li>
<li><p>Before conducting a study, we need to know what effect size we are interested in detecting</p></li>
<li><p>We need to ensure that our study has sufficient power to detect this effect size</p></li>
<li><p>Very large samples will show very small effects as statistically significant (but these may not be important)</p></li>
