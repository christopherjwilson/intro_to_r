However, it is best practice to write code in a script. You will see output from your code in the console.\nEnvironment/History: This pane shows you the objects that you have created in R, and the history of the commands that you have run.\nFiles/Plots/Packages/Help: These panes allow you to navigate your files, view plots, manage packages, and access help documentation.\n\nYou will learn more about these panes as you work through the course.\n\n\n\nR Studio IDE\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Differences between SPSS and R\nR is a statistical programming language, while SPSS is a point-and-click software package. This means that in R, you write code to perform tasks, while in SPSS, you click buttons and select options from menus.\nThis can take some getting used to, but there are many advantages to using R:\n\nReproducibility: You can save your code and rerun it at any time, ensuring that your analysis is reproducible.\nFlexibility: You can write code to perform any task you like, rather than being limited to the options available in a menu.\nCommunity: R has a large and active community of users who share code and help each other to solve problems.\n\nWith R, you won’t manipulate your source data files. Instead, you load the data into R and manipulate it in R. This means that you can always go back to your original data and start again if you need to.",

This is a text file that contains the code that you want to run. You can write and run code in the console, but it is best practice to write code in a script. This allows you to save your code and run it again later IT also makes it easier to see what you have done.\nTo open a new script in R Studio, click on File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. This will open a new script in the top-left pane of R Studio.\nYou can write code in the script, and then run it by selecting the code that you want to run and clicking the Run button at the top of the script pane. You can also run code by pressing Ctrl + Enter on your keyboard.\nTo save your script, click on File &gt; Save As... and save the file with a .R extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganising your work\n\n\n\nIt is good practice to keep your work organised by putting your scripts, data, and other files in a folder on your computer, for each project that you work on.\nRStudio also allows the creation of projects. You can create a new project in R Studio by clicking on File &gt; New Project.... This will create a new folder on your computer where you can save your scripts, data, and other files. If you save your script in the project folder, you can easily access it by opening the project in R Studio. If you use projects, be aware that R Studio will load the last project you worked on when you open the software.",

For example, you can create an object called numbers that contains a set of numbers like this:\nnumbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nBreaking this code down:\n\nnumbers is the name of the object that you are creating.\n&lt;- is the assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right-hand side of the operator to the object on the left-hand side.\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is the data that you are assigning to the object. In this case, it is a set of numbers.\n\nWhen you run this code, R will create an object called numbers that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. You will be ab` le to see the object in the Environment pane in R Studio.\nYou can then use the object in your code, instead of typing out the data each time (see Section 1.3.2 for example).\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 What are functions?\nFunctions are code that have been written to perform a specific task. You can use functions in R to perform tasks like reading data into R, summarising data, and creating plots.\nFor example, the mean() function calculates the mean of a set of numbers. You can use the mean() function like this:\nnumbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nmean(numbers)\nFunctions in R have a name, followed by parentheses. You can pass arguments to the function inside the parentheses. In this case, the mean() function takes a set of numbers as an argument, and returns the mean of those numbers.\nTo learn more about a function, you can use the help() function. For example, to learn more about the mean() function, you can run the following code:\nhelp(mean)\nYou can also use the ? operator to get help on a function. For example, to get help on the mean() function, you can run the following code:\n\n?mean\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 What are packages?\nR has many built-in functions that you can use to perform tasks. However, there are also many packages available that contain additional functions. You can install these packages onto your conputer and then load them into your R session whenever you want to use them.\nTo install a package, you can use the install.packages() function. For example, to install the tidyverse package, you would run the following code:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nTo load a package into your R session, you can use the library() function. For example, to load the tidyverse package, you would run the following code:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nOnce you have loaded a package, you can use the functions in that package in your code. For example, the tidyverse package contains functions for data manipulation and visualisation.",

However, this new data frame will not be saved anywhere, so if you want to save it, you need to assign it to a new object. Tp do this, you can use the assignment operator &lt;-.\n\n# Filter the data frame to select only the rows where the age variable is greater than 30 and save the result to a new data frame called new_data\n\nnew_data &lt;- my_data %&gt;% filter(age &gt; 30)\n\nIn this code, on the left side of the assignment operator &lt;-, we have new_data, which is the name of the new data frame that will contain only the filtered subset of the data (i.e., the values where the age variable is greater than 30). The difference between this code and the previous code is that we are now saving the result to a new data frame called new_data, instead of just printing it to the console.\nWe can also combine multiple conditions when subsetting data. For example, we can select only the rows where the age variable is greater than 25 and the height variable is greater than 175.\n\n# Filter the data frame to select only the rows where the age variable is greater than 25 and the height variable is greater than 175\n\nmy_data %&gt;% filter(age &gt; 25 & height &gt; 175)\n\n     name age height      car\n1 Charlie  35    180 Electric\n2   Frank  50    190 Electric\n\n\nThere are many other ways to subset data in R, depending on the criteria you want to use. For example, you can use the select() function to select specific columns, the arrange() function to sort the data, and the mutate() function to create new variables. We will cover some of these functions in later sections.",

The car variable is the grouping variable, and the mean_age variable is the summary statistic that we calculated for each group.\nYou can also calculate other summary statistics, such as the median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum, using the summarise() function. You can also calculate multiple summary statistics at the same time by specifying multiple variables inside the summarise() function. For example, you can calculate the mean and standard deviation of the age variable for each group of cars.\n\n# Group the data frame by the car variable and calculate the mean and standard deviation of the age variable for each group\n\nmy_data %&gt;% group_by(car) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_age = mean(age), sd_age = sd(age)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  car      mean_age sd_age\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Electric     36.7  12.6 \n2 Petrol       38.3   7.64\n\n\nIn this code, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the age variable for each group of cars.
