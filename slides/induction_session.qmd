## Overview

-   Introduction to the module

-   Outline of approach to learning on the module

-   Discussion of research as a trainee

## What are the aims of the module?

-   Refresh and develop the knowledge and skills gained from undergraduate research teaching. 

-   Develop a critical understanding of research methods. 

-   Develop skills in qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis. 

-   Designed to explicitly prepare you for further research activity (e.g., small scale projects and doctoral thesis). 

-   Please see module handbook for more information. 

## What will we be doing?

-   Some of the sessions are focused on qualitative research

-   Some are on quantitative research

-   Some are focused on thesis development

# How are the sessions structured? {.section}

# Using R for statistical analysis {.section}

## Why learn R?

-   Free and open source
-   Widely used in academia and in the [NHS](https://nhsrcommunity.com/)
-   Powerful and flexible

## Benefits of learning R

-   It separates the analysis and interpretation from a single software package

-   Your code is reproducible and can be shared with others

-   It forces you to understand what you are doing (if you work through the code)

# 

R software is already installed on the university machines, and will be available in the labs that the sessions take place in. You can download R on your personal machine too.

You can also use Posit cloud (not for confidential data)

# Research Methods Assignments (Year 1) {.section}

## Formative Assignments

There are 2 formative assignments during the module:

-   Formative 1: Statistics Assignment (Jan)
-   Formative 2: Qualitative Reflection (Feb)

Full details and dates are on Blackboard site

## Summative Assignment

There is 1 summative assignment for the module:

-   Research panel presentation (May)

We will have sessions to help you prepare for this. The presentation will be based on your research proposal for your thesis.

## Small scale service improvement projects

-   Completing a SSSIP is a requirement of training.

-   You will complete an SSSIP whilst on placement.

-   You are required to submit a report of your SSSIP early in second year, for the Y2 research methods module. 

-   However, most trainees complete conduct the SSSIP during placements one or two. 

-   Please read the research handbook for more information. 

# Approaching to research methods in the programme {.section}

## Year 1

The quantitative portion of the module is built around some key concepts:

- Designing research that examines *why* things happen, not just *what* happens

- Understanding the importance of robust design and sample size in clinical research

- Applying a modelling approach to analysis to answer these types of questions

## How the classes will work

- Each session will have a lecture component and a practical component

- The practical component will outline a specific analysis approach

- There is some reading that is relevant to each session (on BB)

- There is an outline of some key R skills that we will use in each session (on BB)

## Some things to consider

- Limitations in research design come primarily from the conceptualisation of the research question

- If you have developed a clear research question, the analysis should be clear 

- You will not use all the techniques we cover, but understanding them will help you understand the literature and design your own research

## Before next session

- Ensure you have R and RStudio installed and working on your device
