# This example uses the mtcars dataset, which is a built-in dataset in R that contains data on various car models.

# Load the mtcars dataset

data(mtcars)

# One-way ANOVA example: Is there a difference in fuel efficiency between cars with different numbers of cylinders?

mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

anova_result <- aov(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl)
