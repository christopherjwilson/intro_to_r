## Overview

There are many ongoing discussions in clinical psychology research. They will be picked up in other sessions this year. Today we will discuss:

-   Translating research into effective treatment

-   Clinical analogue studies

-   Open and reproducable research

## Research designs in clinical psychology

-   A wide range of approaches are commonly used: Experimental and quasi-experimental, correlational, case study, and qualitative designs.

-   To investigate psychological disorders, assessment, treatment, prevention, professional training, ethics, and cultural diversity.

## Types of psychopathology research

[@ComerKendall2013]

## Experimental psychopathology research example {.smaller}

@PetersEtAl2011 employed an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that attributional style may be one causative factor of depression vulnerability.

-   Undergraduate students, without a history of depression, were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: resilience condition or vulnerability condition

-   The resiliency condition:

    -   descriptions that promoted a selfworthy, stable attribution of a positive event
    -   descriptions that promoted an unstable attribution unrelated to self-worth for a negative event

-   The vulnerability condition:

    -   descriptions that promoted a self-deﬁcient, stable attribution of a negative event
    -   descriptions that promoted an unstable attribution unrelated to self-worth for a positive event.

## Experimental psychopathology research example

-   Following exposure to the assigned descriptions, all participants subsequently completed a stressor task (i.e., Cognitive Ability Test).

-   Peters and colleagues measured the change in mood state from before to after manipulation.

-   Results indicated that individuals in the resilience condition reported less depressed mood (compared to the vulnerability condition) in response to the academic stressor

## Experimental psychopathology research

Sometimes referred to as "Type 1" clinical research [@ComerKendall2013]

-   Able to identify putative causal variables that are directly manipulable (i.e., How or why might psychopathology develop?).

-   May serve as the "building blocks" of future intervention eﬀorts.

-   Rarely followed through to the point of application.

## Quasi experimental research example

@FelminghamEtAl2010 recorded fMRI data in both male and female participants with a diagnosis of PTSD.

-   Trauma-exposed controls, and non-- trauma-exposed controls while they viewed masked facial expressions of fear.

-   Findings indicated that exposure to trauma was associated with enhanced brainstem activity to fear in women, regardless of the presence of PTSD

-   However, in men, brainstem activity was associated only with the development of PTSD.

## Quasi experimental psychopathology research {.smaller}

Sometimes referred to as "Type II" clinical research [@ComerKendall2013]

-   Type II research can help identify independent variables that exacerbate, or modify the expression of, existing forms of abnormal behavior

-   Cannot to answer causal questions about the development of psychopathology due to pre-existence in sample and interaction with so many other variables

    -   Diagnosis is a summary of cumulative history but said history cannot be used to infer what caused diagnosis

-   If the IV is a clinical intervention, then could examine variables that either prevent or ameliorate psychopathology

## What were the differences between the two example studies?

-   The first example study had identified a putative causal variable that was directly manipulable (i.e., attributional style).

-   This could tell us something about how or why psychopathology might develop.

-   The second example study tried to gain a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms that might be related to PTSD.

-   The study did not attempt to explain a causal relationship between the variables.

# Takeaway:

It is important to understand what you are trying to achieve with your research and what is possible with the research design you choose.
