## Overview

There are many ongoing discussions in clinical psychology research. They will be picked up in other sessions this year. Today we will discuss:

-   Translating research into effective treatment

-   Clinical analogue studies

-   Open and reproducible research

## Research designs in clinical psychology

-   A wide range of approaches are commonly used: Experimental and quasi-experimental, cor relational, case study, and qualitative designs.

-   To investigate psychological disorders, assessment, treatment, prevention, professional training, ethics, and cultural diversity.

## Types of psychopathology research

![](images/psychopathologyResearch.png)

[@ComerKendall2013]

## Experimental psychopathology research

Sometimes referred to as "Type 1" clinical research [@ComerKendall2013]

-   Able to identify putative causal variables that are directly manipulable (i.e., How or why might psychopathology develop?).

-   May serve as the "building blocks" of future intervention eﬀorts.

-   Rarely followed through to the point of application.

## Experimental psychopathology research example {.smaller}

@PetersEtAl2011 employed an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that attributional style may be one causative factor of depression vulnerability.

-   Undergraduate students, without a history of depression, were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: resilience condition or vulnerability condition

-   Following exposure to the assigned descriptions, all participants subsequently completed a stressor task

-   Peters and colleagues measured the change in mood state from before to after manipulation.

-   Results indicated that individuals in the resilience condition reported less depressed mood (compared to the vulnerability condition) in response to the academic stressor

resilience: descriptions that promoted a selfworthy, stable attribution of a positive event descriptions that promoted an unstable attribution unrelated to self-worth for a negative event

The vulnerability condition: - descriptions that promoted a self-deﬁcient, stable attribution of a negative event - descriptions that promoted an unstable attribution unrelated to self-worth for a positive

## Quasi experimental psychopathology research {.smaller}

Sometimes referred to as "Type II" clinical research [@ComerKendall2013]

-   Type II research can help identify independent variables that exacerbate, or modify the expression of, existing forms of abnormal behavior

-   Cannot to answer causal questions about the development of psychopathology due to pre-existence in sample and interaction with so many other variables

    -   Diagnosis is a summary of cumulative history but said history cannot be used to infer what caused diagnosis

-   If the IV is a clinical intervention, then could examine variables that either prevent or ameliorate psychopathology

::: notes
\## Quasi experimental research example

@FelminghamEtAl2010 recorded fMRI data in both male and female participants with a diagnosis of PTSD.

-   Trauma-exposed controls, and non-- trauma-exposed controls while they viewed masked facial expressions of fear.

-   Findings indicated that exposure to trauma was associated with enhanced brainstem activity to fear in women, regardless of the presence of PTSD

-   However, in men, brainstem activity was associated only with the development of PTSD.

## What were the differences between the two types of studies?

-   The first type can identify a putative causal variable that was directly manipulable.

    -   This could tell us something about how or why psychopathology might develop.

-   The second type might to gain a deeper understanding of the processs or experiences.

    -   The study did not attempt to explain a causal relationship between the variables.

# Takeaway:

It is important to understand what you are trying to achieve with your research and what is possible with the research design you choose.

# What is basic clinical research?

"any type of psychological research investigating processes that are involved in the development and/or maintenance of psychopathology across any level of explanation (e.g., biological, cognitive, behavioral)" [@EhringEtAl2022]

-   Could also be called fundamental or core research

## Why does basic research matter?

Information about core psychological processes is essential to:

-   clarify how particular psychological disorders develop, are maintained, and ultimately how they may be prevented

-   guide treatment development if the psychopathology process of interest can be modeled with sufficient detail

## How much are treatments informed by research?

-   Only 23% of treatments showed a very strong link between basic research and the development of the intervention, and further 20% showed a strong link

## Some of the issues with translating cinical psychology research into treatment/intervention

-   Lack of stability and replicability of basic research findings

-   Lack of basic studies establishing causality before moving to testing complex clinical intervention

-   Fat-handed interventions and easy-to-vary theories

-   Imbalance between research focused on efficacy compared to research on mediators, mechanisms of change, and moderators

## Lack of stability and replicability of basic research findings

Research findings in clinical psychology are not as reliable as assumed, due to:

-   Use of unreliable measures
-   Underpowered samples
-   Publication bias
-   Lack of transparency in research practices

## Lack of basic studies establishing causality before moving to testing complex clinical intervention

-   Targets for intervention are often identified via correlational studies

-   Once identified, they are often tested in applied studies using novel or modified interventions

-   This misses two important steps:

1.  Is the target a *cause* of psychopathology?
2.  *How* do we modify interventions to change this target?

> These questions need to be answered through basic research.

## Overly-broad interventions and easy-to-vary theories

-   Establishing causality is difficult in psychological research

-   Interventions often lack precision in terms of what they are targeting

-   Can lack clear theoretical framework of the mechanisms of change and how psychological processes (e.g., attention, perception, memory, emotion) are involved

-   Theories are often easy to vary, and can be used to explain almost any outcome

## Imbalance between research focused on efficacy compared to research on mechanisms of change

-   In order to improve treatments, we need to understand *how* and *why* they work, not just *if* they work

-   To get a complete understanding of a treatment, we need to understand: Efficacy, Mediators, Mechanisms of change, Moderators

-   This requires whole programs of research, not just a single study

# Takeaways:

-   Too many clinical studies are focused on efficacy, and not enough on mediators, mechanisms of change.

-   Too many efficacy studies are focused on complex interventions, and theories are often "elastic" to explain any outcome.

# Clinical Analogue Studies {background-image="images/cog1.jpg" background-color="black"}

## What are clinical analogue studies?

-   Clinical analogue studies are studies that use non-clinical samples to study processes related to psychopathology.

    -   For example: The role of attention in PTSD
    -   Is this a form of attentional bias towards threat stimuli or an inability to disengage from threat stimuli?

-   They allow us to study processes related to psychopathology in a controlled environment.

-   They allow specific variables to be manipulated to identify mechanisms of change.

## Why use clinical analogue studies? #1

-   Research with clinical groups is often correlational which does not allow drawing conclusions about what causation.

-   The use of experimental designs with clinical population can be ethically problematic, as exposure to stimuli (e.g., stressors) to measure "in the moment" effects, could be traumatic.

-   Retrospective reports lack objective information about external stumuli or order of events.

## Why use clinical analogue studies? #2

-   Subclinical measurements can allow accurate modelling of relevant processes (e.g. Depression: @HillEtAl1987).

-   Allows design of studies to better understand the relationship between:

    -   treatment -\> process\
    -   process -\> outcome

[@EhringEtAl2022]

-   Allows control and focus on specific variables to identify mechanisms of change [@EhringEtAl2022]

## Intervention -\> process -\> outcome

## Clinical relevance of analogue studies

-   "the nature and intensity of the target problem, not the clinical status of the subjects, are the critical variables in analogue research" (e.g., fear and phobias: @BorkovecRachman1979, p. 253).

-   Basic research has helped identify etiological factors in the development of many disorders (e.g. OCD: @Gibbs1996)

-   Symptoms can be prevalent in non-clinical populations, with similar qualitative expressions of experience and similar causal and maintenance factors [@AbramowitzEtAl2014, @AbramowitzEtAl2001, @PuckettEtAl]

## Limitations of clinical analogue studies? #1

Potential issues with clinical analogue studies include:

-   Ecological validity: the extent to which the findings of a research study are able to be generalized to real-life settings.

-   External validity: the extent to which the findings of a research study are able to be generalized to other people, settings, and times.

-   Comorbidity: the presence of one or more additional disorders (or diseases) co-occurring with a primary disorder or disease.

## Limitations of clinical analogue studies? #2 {.smaller}

However, it has been argued that the limitations of clinical analogue studies are often overstated [@AbramowitzEtAl2014] and that the weaknesses of clinical analogue studies are often shared with clinical studies (i.e. poor research is poor research, regardless of the sample):

-   Lack of sufficient power in studies
-   Reliance on findings from single studies that have yet to be replicated
-   Weakness in research designs
-   Over-reliance on or misunderstanding of NHST
-   Diagnostic unreliability
-   Selective reporting of results

# Takeaways:

-   Clinical analogue studies are studies are an improtant part of studying processes related to psychopathology.

-   They can help us break down the intervention -\> process -\> outcome relationship.

-   They need to be well designed and well conducted to be useful.

# Open Science {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1457369804613-52c61a468e7d" background-color="black"}

## What is open and reproducable research?

-   Reproducible research is the idea that research is published with their hypotheses, research plan, materials, data and software code so that others can try to replicate the results and verify the findings.

-   Studies are pre-registered, so that researchers can see if the study was conducted as planned and the results support the researchers' original hypotheses.

## Why Reproducable Research?

-   One of the major limitations of clinical research can be lack of transparency and reproducibility

-   Linked to the "easy to vary" problem

-   Linked to the "underpowered" problem

-   Linked to the "publication bias" problem

-   Linked to the "file drawer" problem

## How does open research help address these problems? {.smaller}

-   Researchers outline their goals and theories before they begin their research, so that they can be held accountable for their results.

-   Sample sizes are determined before the study begins, so that the study is adequately powered to detect the effect size of interest.

-   Researchers are encouraged to make all of their results available, regardless of whether the results are statistically significant (where possible).

-   Materials, data and code are made available, so that others can try to replicate the results and verify the findings.
